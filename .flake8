# Justifications for each ignored error or warning:
# * E252: equals for a default argument should look distinct from assignment.
# * E302: always requiring two blank lines rather than one between top-level items is too annoying and nitpicky.
# * E402: we want imports for tests to go between the main code and the tests.
# * W503, W504: these give false positives for the style of avoiding \ at the end of each line by using parens.
