"""
Abstractions for Byzantine Fault-Tolerant protocols.

The model of a BFT protocol assumed here was written for the purpose
of Crosslink, based on the example of adapted-Streamlet ([CS2020] as
modified in [Crosslink]). It might not be sufficient for other BFT
protocols â€” but that's okay; it's a prototype.
